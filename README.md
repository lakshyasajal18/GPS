This Python script facilitates finding routes between cities on a map using breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. It consists of classes `City` and `Map`, along with functions `bfs`, `main`, and `parse_args`.

- The `City` class represents a city on the map. It has attributes for the city's name and its neighbors, with methods to initialize a city, add neighboring cities, and provide a string representation.

- The `Map` class represents the map itself, with cities and their connections. It initializes with relationships between cities provided as input. It creates city objects and establishes connections between them. The representation method displays the list of cities.

- The `bfs` function performs a breadth-first search to find the shortest path between two cities. It takes a graph, starting city, and destination city as input. It explores the graph starting from the given start city until it finds the destination city using a queue-based approach. This function is crucial for finding the shortest route between two cities.

- The `main` function orchestrates the execution of the script. It creates a map object using provided connections, then utilizes the `bfs` function to find the route between the starting and destination cities. It prints driving instructions along the route.

- The `parse_args` function is a utility to parse command-line arguments. It uses the `argparse` module to parse input arguments specifying the starting and destination cities.

The script can be run from the command line, providing starting and destination cities as arguments, and it will output driving instructions for the shortest route between them. The BFS algorithm ensures the shortest path is found efficiently, making it suitable for finding routes on a map.
